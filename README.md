# OOP in Python â€“ Smartphone & Polymorphism Assignment
## Introduction
This project demonstrates the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It introduces classes, objects, attributes, constructors, inheritance, and polymorphism using practical examples.
### Part 1: Smartphone Class Example
The first part of the assignment focuses on creating a class that represents a smartphone. The class includes attributes such as color and model, and we create multiple objects with unique values.
To extend the example, inheritance is introduced by adding a new class with a battery life attribute, showing how a child class can reuse and extend the properties of its parent class.
### Part 2: Polymorphism Challenge
The second part of the assignment explores polymorphism. Several classes are created (Car, Plane, Boat, Bird), and each of them includes a method with the same name: move.
Even though the method name is the same, each class defines its own version of the method. For example, a car object displays "Driving", a plane object displays "Flying", a boat object displays "Sailing", and a bird object also displays "Flying".
This demonstrates how polymorphism allows different objects to share the same method name while producing different behaviors.
## Key Learnings
How to define and use classes and objects in Python.
How to create constructors with unique values for each object.
How inheritance helps in reusing and extending code.
How polymorphism allows methods with the same name to behave differently across multiple classes.
